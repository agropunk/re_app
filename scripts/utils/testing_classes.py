# %% Inheritance
# i.e.
class DerivedClassName(modname.BaseClassName):
    None 

# %% Built-in functions with inheritance
# Use isinstance() to check an instanceâ€™s type: isinstance(obj, int) will be True only if obj.__class__ is int or some class derived from int.

# Use issubclass() to check class inheritance: issubclass(bool, int) is True since bool is a subclass of int. However, issubclass(float, int) is False since float is not a subclass of int.

# %% private variables
# a name prefixed with an underscore (e.g. _spam)
    # should be treated as a non-public part of the API, 
    # whether as a function, method or data member

# valid use-case for class-private members is to avoid clashes of names with subclasses
    # 'name mangling'
    #  Any identifier of the form __spam (at least two leading underscores, at most one trailing underscore) is textually replaced with _classname__spam, where classname is the current class name with leading underscore(s) stripped.
